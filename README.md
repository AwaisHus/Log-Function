# Log-Function-InteractiveWebsite

I have developed a PHP log function, enabling website administrators to monitor user activity for debugging purposes and to safeguard against potential SQL injection attacks. This function provides feedback within the admin panel, but for confidentiality reasons, I am only sharing the code for the log function itself. It gathers information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details on the nature of the issue for tracking purposes.
