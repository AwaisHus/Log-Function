# Log-Function
A PHP log function has been implemented to facilitate website administrators in tracking user activity, primarily for debugging purposes and the prevention of SQL injection attacks. This function conveys feedback through the admin panel, although only the log function code is disclosed here due to the project's sensitive nature. It captures data such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, and notes on the cause of issues for comprehensive monitoring.
