# Log-Function
I've added a PHP log function to help our website administrators keep tabs on user actions. This primarily aids in debugging and guarding against SQL injection attacks. It's a handy tool that can be placed anywhere in the code where actions occur, such as when a user clicks a button or enters login information.

This log function provides feedback through the admin panel, but I can only share the code for the function itself here due to confidentiality. Here's a summary of what it does:

- Captures the user's IP address.
- Grabs the user's MAC address.
- Records the user's input.
- It logs the time when the action took place.

This simple addition enhances our website's security and helps us identify and address issues more efficiently.
